# Java Graph Exploration
Author: Nicholas O'Kelley

## What does it do?
This simple program allows the user to load in with a map (a text file with a graph)
and perform various graph seraches and analysis processes. The user can also,
chose to load a different map and the program will display all files in the 
map directory. This allowing the user to select different maps in a single 
program execution.

## The Purpose:
This purpose of this program was to allow me to further my research in graph
theory while also using a different programming language/paradigm to achieve
a similar result. Most of the algorithms were learned from books and/or just 
reading the wiki pages and watching some youtube videos.

## Know issues:
* Need to make the Vertex list have a header and appropriate spacing.
* Might be a couple uncaught exceptions, but will be patched as they are found
* Clearing the screen wasnt working and needs to be looked at in the future

## Future Goals:
I hope to add in more algorithms that handle graphs such as:
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* Breadth First Search
* A*
* A functioning clear screen method
